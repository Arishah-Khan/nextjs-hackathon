# FoodTuck Q-Commerce Website - Day 5

**Date**: 20/01/2025  
**Prepared By**: Arishah

## Objective
The task for **Day 5** focused on improving backend functionality and error handling to ensure the application runs smoothly. Functional testing was implemented, and issue resolution was carried out for the marketplace application.

## Testing & Refinement Steps

### 1. Functional Testing
**What I did**:  
- I thoroughly tested the application by focusing on key features such as user registration, login, product addition, and order placement.
  
**Tools Used**:  
- **Postman** for API testing.
- **Lighthouse** for performance evaluation.

**Outcome**:  
- The application’s main functionalities were successfully tested, ensuring that all features work as expected.

### 2. Error Handling
**What I did**:  
- Implemented proper error handling across the website to ensure users encounter user-friendly error messages in case of unexpected issues or system errors.

**Outcome**:  
- The user experience was enhanced with proper error messaging.
- The backend was refined to optimize response times by removing unnecessary server requests.

### 3. Backend Integration Refinement
**Fetching Data from Sanity CMS**:  
- I fetched data from Sanity CMS, where I had stored the food items data.
- Used Sanity API endpoint and wrote a **GROQ** query to retrieve the required data.

**Testing with Postman**:  
- I used Postman to send a GET request to fetch data from the Sanity API and successfully retrieved food items data in JSON format.

**Test Steps**:
1. Constructed the URL for the API query:
2. Added the Authorization header with a valid token for secure access.
3. Triggered the request to fetch food items data from Sanity.
4. Checked the response status and structure of the returned data.

**Expected Result**:  
- The API should return a list of food items, formatted correctly, with relevant details such as name, description, and price.

**Actual Result**:  
- The API successfully returned the expected data, confirming that the integration is working as expected.

### 4. React Testing Library: Component Testing
**Test Steps**:  
- Imported necessary testing utilities from React Testing Library.
- Created test cases for rendering components, simulating user actions, and validating that the components handle interactions and edge cases correctly.

**Outcome**:  
- Some tests passed successfully, but a few failed due to issues such as:
- Incorrect rendering of dynamic data.
- Misbehavior in user interactions (like button clicks not triggering the expected results).
- Some components not handling edge cases properly.

**Status**: Partial Pass (Some Tests Failed)

### 5. Error Handling Implementation
**State Management for Error**:  
- Used the **useState** hook to manage error messages.
- If an error occurs during the API call, the error message is captured and displayed using **react-toastify** to show notifications to the user.

### 6. Performance Optimization with Lighthouse
- I used Google Chrome Developer Tools to run a Lighthouse audit, which provided a detailed report on:
- Performance: Page speed and load time.
- Accessibility: Usability for users with disabilities.
- SEO: Search engine optimization.
- Best Practices: Coding standards.

**Optimizations Implemented**:
- Removed unused CSS.
- Enabled browser caching.
- Optimized JavaScript bundles.

**Outcome**:  
- The changes significantly improved the page's loading speed and overall performance.

### 7. Cross-Browser and Device Testing with BrowserStack
- I used BrowserStack to test the website across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.
- Conducted tests on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices to verify consistency in functionality and layout.

**Outcome**:  
- Successfully identified and fixed cross-browser and device-related issues, improving the user experience.
